## Headings

* There are six headings HTML: `h1` to `h6`.
* They are block elements by default.
* The heading `h1` should be used only once per document.
  It is seen as the title of the document
* You can use other elements within a heading, even images,
  but don't expect search engines to understand them correctly.

Example:
``` html
<h1>Title of the document</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
...
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

## Paragraphs

* Paragraphs `p` are areas of text.
* By default, they are block elements.
* Paragraphs create a carriage return when closed.
* You can force a linebreak with `br` within a paragraph
  without ending the `p` element.
* You can use other elements within a paragraph, but you
  should actually only use `span`s, `br`s, and text
  style items like `strong`, `em` etc.
  
Example:
``` html
<p>
  Qui primum illud sensit, reptatus de asino.
  <em>A iocus</em>
</p>
```
