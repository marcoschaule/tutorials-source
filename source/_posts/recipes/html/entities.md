## Overview

* Entities are special text formats to represent special characters.
* They can be written with their name (if available) like `&entity_name;`
  or with their number like `&#entity_number;`. They always start with
  an `&` and end with an `;`.
* Entity names are case sensitive.
* Entities are actually part of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
  
Example:
`&copy; or &#169;` produces &copy;.

## Best Practices

* _Do_ use entities whenever you are about to use special characters.
* _Do_ use the non-breaking hyphen (`&#8209;`) to use a hyphen
  character (`â€‘`) that won't break.
