## Overview

* The doctype defines the type of HTML the document uses. For today, only HTML5
  makes sense. The doctype is placed at the very beginning of the web page. 
* By using the doctype, you can validate your HTML against the W3C HTML validator.

Example:
``` html
<!doctype html>
<html>
...
```
