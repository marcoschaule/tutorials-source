### HTML - Advanced - HTML5 (Semantic Web)

#### Overview

* In HTML5, semantic web elements for most common areas were added.
  The mostly used elements are `article`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`
  `main`, `section`, `details` and so on...
* These elements are an improved way to structure your page for
  search engines, which doesn't mean that old structures are ranked
  worse because of the lack of HTML5 features. Nobody knows _exactly_
  how Google (and others) rank the pages. Its just a recommendation.
