* _Do_ give IDs and classes **expressive names** like `.top-heading` or `.float-left`
  in contrast to `.a` or `.b`. (You understand, Kevin?!?)
* _Do_ use `id`s in declarative style.
* _Do_ use **dash-case names** for classes and IDs!
* _Do_ use **IDs rarly** since their usage can lead to problems!
