Asynchronous JavaScript
-----------------------

1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  In JavaScript, callbacks are used to
  * handle asynchronous functions.
  * handle synchronous functions.
  * communicate between client and server.
  * call deeplinks from other clients.

1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  In JavaScript, callbacks
  * have an error object for the last argument.
  * have an error object for the first argument.
  * should be the last argument in a function call.
  * should be the first argument in a function call.
  
1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  The `Async` library is used to
  * handle asynchronous series (arrays with asynchronous functions).
  * handle communication between client and server.
  * loop over arrays of asynchronous functions.
  * handle deeplinks from other clients.
  
1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  The Q-Library uses promises, which
  * are objects.
  * are used to avoid callback structures (so called callback hells).
  * promise the user to be resolved or rejected.
  * use handlers instead of callbacks.
  

AngularJS 1.x
-------------

1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  In AngularJS, the feature `Controller`
  * is a singleton and is used to keep data in memory, even in-between views.
  * is not a singleton and gets instantiated for each (bound) view.
  * is a tool to teach HTML "new tricks" like `<my-thing></my-thing>`.
  * is used to transform Angular expressions.

1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  In AngularJS, the feature `Service`
  * is a singleton and is used to keep data in memory, even in-between views.
  * is not a singleton and gets instantiated for each (bound) view.
  * is a tool to teach HTML "new tricks" like `<my-thing></my-thing>`.
  * is used to transform Angular expressions.

1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  In AngularJS, the feature `Directive`
  * is a singleton and is used to keep data in memory, even in-between views.
  * is not a singleton and gets instantiated for each (bound) view.
  * is a tool to teach HTML "new tricks" like `<my-thing></my-thing>`.
  * is used to transform Angular expressions.

1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  In AngularJS, the feature `Filter`
  * is a singleton and is used to keep data in memory, even in-between views.
  * is not a singleton and gets instantiated for each (bound) view.
  * is a tool to teach HTML "new tricks" like `<my-thing></my-thing>`.
  * is used to transform Angular expressions.

1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  In AngularJS, the `$scope`
  * is a "namespace" for controllers.
  * can be used to bind the model to the view.
  * is inherited by child controllers.
  * is an object that represents the ViewModel.

1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  AngularJS uses the MVVM-Pattern, which
  * stands for "Model View ViewModel".
  * is a special version of the "Model View Controller (MVC)" pattern.
  * is totally different from the "Model View Controller (MVC)" pattern.
  * makes the controller be unaware of the model and the view.

1. Which expression(s) is/are correct?

  In AngularJS, the Router is a feature
  * we did not cover in the courses.
  * we did not cover in the courses at all.
  * that could be used to route in-between views.
  * that could be part of the Angular core.
